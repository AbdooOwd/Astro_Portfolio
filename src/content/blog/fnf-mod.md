# Why'd I make this
So, it's no secret that **Friday Night Funkin'** is *(kinda)* dead, and this is due to the fact that *some* people
make it really cringe, or just *"juice"* it *(same concept/idea like **.exe** kind-of mods)*. But don't get me wrong!
There are really great mods out there! Like **"A Nonsensical Friday Night"**, **"Terra Funk"**... *etc*

I wanna make this mod because I always wanted to make a game/app that isn't *too easy* to make, and by that I mean
that I want way that requires ONLY code, not like Godot *(best game engine btw)*. So, in **Friday Night Funkin**'s 
__***source code***__ you only ***code***.
