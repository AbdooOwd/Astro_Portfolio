## I sometimes have Weeb Moments
I read mangas, I watch animes. But I don't call myself a weeb, I watch anime when
I really have nothing to do or when I wanna get some "weeb vibes" I guess?
So I sometimes get what you might call a **"Weeb Moment"**.

**"Weeb Moment"** is when I'm too bored, or I wanna get hyped up, or just
bright up my mood, it's there that I watch animes.
If you're still asking why, I might just asnwer you with:
* I'm too bored.
* I don't wanna play any game *(outside, board game, video game... etc)*.
* I might be sad *(kind of rare)*.
* Maybe I just wanna watch.

Or maybe all at the same time.
