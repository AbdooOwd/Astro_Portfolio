One day, for fun. I started making a **programming language**!

## How did you make it?
So **__A--__** is a programming/scripting language I made because I was bored.
I first made it using **__Python__**, but there we're 2 problems:
* The user had to install Python to use it, but I wanted a standalone interpreter.
* Python is popular for its slowness, you can't really notice it if you make simple programs.
But I thought that if the language became more complex with more features, I will need *speed*.
So I recoded the Python interpreter *(Thanks ChatGPT!)* to **C++**. Because of:
    * Its speed.
    * It can compile the interpreter.

## How does it work?
So, **__A--__** works the same way in both __Python__ and __C++__ 
*(except the Python version isn't being updated anymore)*.
A-- works by scanning each individual character in the code's file.

Why you say? Because I wanted to make a programming language all on my own
*(I used ChatGPT to translate the Python version to C++ because I know Python more)*.
And I didn't know anything about tokens and all. But when I realized that it might be better,
I just was too lazy to do it. Maybe another time? Maybe it will be rewritten in Python?
*(cuz we all know [this video]() when we want to make a programming language)*
