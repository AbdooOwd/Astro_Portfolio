One day, for fun. I started making a **programming language**!

## How did you make it?
So **__A--__** is a programming/scripting language I made because I was bored.
I first made it using **__Python__**, but there we're 2 problems:
* The user had to install Python to use it, but I wanted a standalone interpreter.
* Python is popular for its slowness, you can't really notice it if you make simple programs.

But I thought that if the language became more complex with more features, I will need *speed*.
So I recoded the Python interpreter *(Thanks ChatGPT!)* to **C++**. Because of:
* Its speed.
* it can compile the interpreter.

***WIP - Coming soon***
