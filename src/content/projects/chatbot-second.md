## Wut?

*"Chatbot-second"* is called like that cuz I made a first one that worked pretty well,
but I optimized it. And so I didn't edit the first one, I made a second one.

## How does it work?

*"Chatbot-second"* works by reading a file called `bot.json`, and you can consider it
its "database", cuz the bot get all of his answers and situations for this
answer from this file. It's after that that it starts "working".

He will scan you sentence and get every word in it *(innit, haha)*, then based on
the words used it will get a response from its database.

## How does it looke like?

For now, *"Chatbot-second"* is kinda dumb, cuz I'm dumb, and the relation between
him and me except the fact that I coded him, is that I made the situations he knows,
and the answers he should get.

And also, he has two looks:
* A terminal version.
* A GUI version.

To switch looks, go to `i forgor.py` and switch `gui` to `True`.
*(I forgot what were the names* :skull: *)*.
