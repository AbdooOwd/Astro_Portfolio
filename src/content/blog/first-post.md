# First Post guys!

After trying out 465,165,214 frameworks/tools *(not real numbers)*, I finally found 
[**__Astro__**](https://astro.build/), a **REALLY** easy cool GigaChad framework to make
sites, and [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) to deploy it. Github Pages is kinda slow.

I wanted an easy tool to just talk about myself + a blog, a ***portfolio*** techincally.

## I'm gonna test stuff now

```cpp
    // Yo! This is code!
    std::cout << "C++ yeah" << endl;
```

* A list?
    * I love math
    * Here is a formula (I love it): `A² + B² = C²` *Pythagoras Theorem*
    * Coding Yee
