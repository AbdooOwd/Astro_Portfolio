### What is this?

**A--** is programming/scripting language I made for fun in a few hours.
It was originally made using **Python**, but was then re-made in **C++**
for a few reasons:
* C++ can compile programs into executables, so it is a standalone interpreter
*(so you don't need Python's interpreter installed to work)*.
* It is faster *(Python is known to be slow)*.
* I'd learn more about C++.

Now for what **A--** *really* is, it is:
* A programming/scripting language.
* It's easy to learn and easy to edit.
* It's easy to modify its interpreter *( `runner.cpp` )*.
* It runs using a standalone interpreter, no need for setups and installations!
