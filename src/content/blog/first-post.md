# First Post guys!

After trying out 465,165,214 frameworks/tools *(not real numbers)*, I finally found 
[**__Astro__**](https://astro.build/), a **REALLY** easy cool GigaChad framework to make
sites, and [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) to deploy it. Github Pages is kinda slow.

I wanted an easy tool to just talk about myself + a blog, a ***portfolio*** techincally.
